        <p class="vilage__description">
          Mountains are majestic landforms that rise prominently above their
          surroundings due to geological processes. They are characterized by
          their significant elevation, steep slopes, and generally rugged
          terrain. Mountains cover about 22% of the Earth's land surface and
          play a crucial role in shaping landscapes, influencing weather
          patterns, and supporting diverse ecosystems.

          Lakes are inland bodies of water that are typically larger and deeper
          than ponds. They can be found all over the world, from high mountain
          regions to low-lying plains, and they play crucial roles in the
          Earth's ecosystems
